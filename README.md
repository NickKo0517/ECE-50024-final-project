## Implementation of PnP-ADMM according to paper by Dr.Stanley. H. Chan
reference: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1605.01710 
## Plan 3/3/2024:
implement only General Linear Inverse Problem for Thursday Deadline (see section 2.4 in attached pdf (user_guide_v1.pdf))

## Project Goal:
* Translate Matlab implementation from Dr.Stanley Chan to Python
* Can reference other repos posted in WeChat

## Progress Thus Far:
* Skeleton code (incomplete) of general ADMM algorithm in .py file
* Reading/annotating user_guide_v1 with relevant information
* Syncing up all existing branches (all branches have the same info for now)

## Recommendation on Getting Started/Working:
* Spend 15 minutes daily in this repo to see if any changes are pushed
* Understand the user guide well (it's fine if you write a little code but have a good understanding)
* If you annotate (add more comments/info) to user_guide_v1, it is okay to push to main branch
* If write code, it is recommended that you push it to your own branch
